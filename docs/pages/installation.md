## Legacy v1 installation

Version 2 of this plugin changed how the plugin themes were setup to take advantage of the new features in IntelliJ 2019.1 that allowed plugins to create custom UI themes. If you are using a 2018 version IDE or Android Studio 3.4 you will be using the legacy version of this plugin. The installation steps are exactly the same except that you must go to `Preferences | Editor | Color Scheme` to select the theme rather than `Preferences | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance`.
