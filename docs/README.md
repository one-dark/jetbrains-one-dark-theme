Welcome to One dark theme for JetBrains! This theme aims to provide JetBrains users with the lovely colors of the [Atom One dark theme][atom-one-dark]. This repository uses Python and YAML to generate the JetBrains color scheme XML files to allow more flexible control.

Contributions are always welcome! Don't feel pressured into putting a lot of time into a pull request or an elaborate issue description, just do what you can and we will work from there.

Finally, thanks to [Egor Yurtaev](https://github.com/yurtaev) who created the repository this project was based on. Without that starting point, this plugin may have never been created.
