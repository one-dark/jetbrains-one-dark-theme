# Introduction

Welcome to One Dark Theme for JetBrains! This theme aims to provide JetBrains users with the lovely colors of the [Atom One Dark Theme](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-syntax). This repository uses Python and YAML to generate the JetBrains color scheme XML files to allow more flexible control.

Contributions are always welcome! Don't feel pressured into putting a lot of time into a pull request or an elaborate issue description, just do what you can and we will work from there.
