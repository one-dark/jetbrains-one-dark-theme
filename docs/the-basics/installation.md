## Legacy v1 installation

Version 2 of this plugin changed how the plugin themes were setup to take advantage of the new features in IntelliJ 2019.1 that allowed plugins to create custom UI themes. If you are using a 2018 version IDE or Android Studio 3.4 you will be using the legacy version of this plugin. The installation steps are exactly the same except that you must go to `Preferences | Editor | Color Scheme` to select the theme rather than `Preferences | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance`.

**NOTE:** The legacy version of this theme does not customize the entire IDE color scheme as shown in the screenshots. Customizing the IDE colors was made available in IntelliJ 2019.1 and does not work for IntelliJ 2018.x or Android Studio 3.4.x. These older IDE versions will only change the editor syntax highlighting colors.
